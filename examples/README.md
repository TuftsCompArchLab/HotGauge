# HotGauge example scripts
These scripts demonstrate how to use **HotGauge** and can be adapted as needed to run the thermal
simulations and analysis needed for your project.

## HotGauge Python Package Requirment
Note that these scripts rely on the **HotGauge** python package, and thus, you must be using a
python environment with **HotGauge** installed. If you created a virtual-environment as suggested in
the README, you can run `source ../env/bin/activate` or the appropriate version for your shell with
an extension of either `.csh` or `.fish`.
