# HotGauge simulation with warmup
This is the directory with scripts associated with the example thermal simulation that includes a
warmup simulation followed by an actual workload. The scripts in this directory show examples of how
to analyze and visualize the resulting thermal and power traces.

## Inputs
This thermal simulation uses an example workload trace located in the `traces` directory

## Scripts
The scripts located in this directory are called
`compute_local_maxima_stats.sh`
,
`plot_vs_time.sh`
,
`visualize_hotspots.sh`
,
and
`visualize_power.sh`
.
They each begin with comments that describe what they do.
